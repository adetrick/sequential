class RNN(Layer):
    '''
    Recurrent neural net (RNN) layer.

    Processes sequential inputs by maintaining a hidden
    state across time steps. At each step, the hidden state
    is updated based on the current input and the previous
    hidden state. Returns hidden states for all time steps.

        activation: str
            Activation function to apply ('relu', 'tanh', or None),

            instead of being reset each call.
        relu_alpha: float
            If using relu activation, providing an alpha (typically .01
            or .001) can help prevent vanishing gradients.

        Propagates gradients backwards through the layer,
        iterating over time steps in reverse.

        Since the hidden state influences subsequent
        time steps in the forward pass, its gradient is 
        accumulated and passed back at each step.

        Variable names mirror those in the forward pass, with a
        leading 'd' to indicate derivatives. For example:

            z -> dz
            h -> dh
            X -> dX

        This helps track how forward variables contribute to 
        the propagated gradients.
